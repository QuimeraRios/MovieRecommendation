# Movie Recommendation
Movie recommendation system

In this project as a Data Engineer I will develop a movie recommendation system. This should be able to answer the following questions:
1. You must return the number of movies produced in a language specified by the user.
2. A movie is entered. It must return the duration and the year.
3. The franchise is entered, returning the number of movies, total and average earnings.
4. A country is entered, returning the number of films produced in it.
5. The production company is entered, giving you the total revenue and the number of films it made.
6. The name of a director found within a dataset is entered and the success of the same measured must be returned through the return. In addition, you must return the name of each film with the release date, individual return, cost and profit of the same, in list format.


## Steps to follow

1. Understand the problem
2. Search the datasets
3. Perform the ETL
4. Do exploratory data analysis
5. Carry out the necessary transformations and create the functions for each one (@app.get('/')).
6. Make queries available using the FastAPI framework
7. Do the Deployment in Render
8. Make Demo Video
